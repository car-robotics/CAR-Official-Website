                            This website started as a semester project done by the students listed above in the Web Team
                            section. We began with a flat white background and some randomly generated Latin text. From there,
                            each member worked throughout the semester to add content and learn about the technologies used
                            to build this site. The website at the end of the semester can be seen{" "}
                            <GreenLink link="http://car-robotics.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/" text="here" />.
                            <br /><br />
                            Since the end of that semester, I, the Matt in the Web Team section, continued working to refine each
                            page for styling consistency, content, and optimizing user experience.<br />
                            <br />
                            The code for this website is open source and available{" "}

                            For those looking to learn React, this could be a good starting point as it gives you something to
                            reference when styling/coding your own components.
